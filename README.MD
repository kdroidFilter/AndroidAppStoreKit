The Google Play Scrapper Library provides a comprehensive way to extract detailed information about applications listed on the Google Play Store. With this library, you can fetch details such as application descriptions, developer information, categories, reviews, and more.

This library is built using Kotlin and leverages kotlinx.serialization for parsing JSON data and Ktor for HTTP requests.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Fetch application details including title, description, developer info, price, etc.
- Extract application categories and genres.
- Retrieve app ratings, reviews, and download counts.
- Identify in-app purchase details and sale statuses.
- Collect metadata like screenshots, icons, and videos.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

This library is available on maven central, add the following dependency to your project:

### Gradle Kotlin DSL

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.kdroid.gplayscrapper:library:0.1.0")
}
```

## ðŸ”„ Usage

### Fetching App Information

To fetch detailed information about a specific app, you can use the `getGooglePlayApplicationInfo` function. This function requires the app ID as a parameter and optionally takes the language and country codes.

#### Example:

```kotlin
import com.kdroid.gplayscrapper.services.getGooglePlayApplicationInfo
import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking
import kotlinx.serialization.encodeToString
import kotlinx.serialization.json.Json

fun main() {
    val json = Json {
        prettyPrint = true
        ignoreUnknownKeys = true
        encodeDefaults = true
    }

    runBlocking {
        val appId = "com.android.chrome" // Replace with the actual app ID
        val appInfo = getGooglePlayApplicationInfo(appId)
        println(json.encodeToString(appInfo))
    }
}
```
